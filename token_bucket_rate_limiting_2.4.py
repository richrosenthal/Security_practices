# With rate limiting, a unique IP address is restricted from making too many requests in a fixed period of time.

# The code snippet below implements rate limiting using a "Token Bucket." Each time a message is received: the bucket is checked for tokens. If the bucket has 1 or more tokens, the algorithm removes one token and sends the message. If no tokens remain in the bucket, the algorithm drops the message.

# Complete line #18 to finish the limit() function and ensure that the API only allows 5 messages per every 10 seconds.

# See commented lines for detailed instructions.

# When correct, this code should produce no output.

# The output to the console will be the following:
